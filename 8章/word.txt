My dad was my hero，all throughout my life. When I was very little，he appeared to be so large. In my eyes he could do anything. We all knew he was in charge. He was a man of great strength both physically and mentally，and he found ways with a kiss and songs sung to me as I woke up. Those days I surely miss. He made me feel so special，“Miss America”he would sing. I knew I had my father‘s love. It gave me courage to do everythings.
